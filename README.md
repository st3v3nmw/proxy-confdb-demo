# A Confdb Demo

Confdb provides a new mechanism for configuring snaps in the snappy ecosystem. They enable configuration sharing between snaps while ensuring proper access control.

For this demo, we'll set up a `network` confdb to share proxy configuration between snaps.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure you're running the latest versions of `snapd` & `snapcraft` (from `stable`). \
> If something doesn't work, try installing the snaps from the `beta` or `edge` channels: \
> `snap refresh snapd --edge` / `snap refresh snapcraft --edge`

## The Past

Traditionally, snap configuration has been tightly coupled to individual snaps, making it difficult to share configuration between snaps. In this example, each of the snaps (Firefox, Chromium, and Brave) have their own proxy configuration set through `snap set` which leads to a lot of duplication.

![The setup](docs/media/setup.png)

We'll look at several hacky workarounds to get around this and how using a confdb can fix this.

### _content_ interface

In this workaround, we'll create an additional snap (`net-ctrl`) that will store the configuration in a file. It exposes this shared file to the other snaps over the [content interface](https://snapcraft.io/docs/content-interface).

![With content interface](docs/media/with-content-interface.png)

### _snapd-control_ interface

In this workaround, we also have an additional snap (`net-ctrl`) that we set snap configuration on (with `snap set`). The other snaps then connect to the [snapd-control](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapd-control-interface) interface and consume this configuration through the [snapd options endpoint `/v2/snaps/net-ctrl/conf`](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapd-api#heading--snaps-name-conf). This is a BAD solution as it effectively grants these snaps `root` access to your device which isn't safe.

## Using Confdb

### Intro

Confdb separates snaps from their configuration, enabling easier cross-snap configuration sharing. A confdb is defined using a [`confdb-schema` assertion](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/core/reference/assertions/confdb-schema/) which looks like this:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When modifying your views or schema, you must bump the `revision` number. Forgetting to increment it is a common mistake: the assertion will be acknowledged, but your changes won't take effect.

```yaml
type: confdb-schema
authority-id: <your-account-id>
account-id: <your-account-id>
revision: <N> # Bump the revision number to <N+1> after updating the assertion
name: <string>
views:
  <view-name>:
    rules:
      -
        request: <string>
        storage: <string>
        access: read|write|read-write # the default is read-write
        content:
          -
            request: <string>
            storage: <string>
            ...
  ...
timestamp: <date -Iseconds --utc>

{
  "storage": {
    "aliases": {
      ...
    },
    "schema": {
      ...
    }
  }
}

<signature>
```

Snaps do not act on the raw configuration in the storage directly. This is mediated by confdb views, allowing the views & storage to evolve independently.

We'll create two views: `proxy-admin` for managing proxy settings, and `proxy-state` for consuming them. The former has `read-write` access while the latter is `read`-only.

```yaml
views:
  proxy-admin:
    rules:
      -
        access: read-write
        content:
          -
            request: url
            storage: url
          -
            request: bypass
            storage: bypass
        request: {protocol}
        storage: proxy.{protocol}
  proxy-state:
    rules:
      -
        access: read
        request: https
        storage: proxy.https
      -
        access: read
        request: ftp
        storage: proxy.ftp
```

Each view has a set of rules that hold the `request` path, the underlying `storage`, and the `access` method. You can use placeholders in the `request` and `storage`. In the example above, `{protocol}` is a placeholder which maps to `proxy.{protocol}`. For instance, `https` maps to `proxy.https`.

The stored configuration respects the following schema:

```json
{
  "storage": {
    "aliases": {
      "protocol": {
        "choices": [
          "http",
          "https",
          "ftp"
        ],
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "schema": {
      "proxy": {
        "keys": "${protocol}",
        "values": {
          "schema": {
            "bypass": {
              "type": "array",
              "unique": true,
              "values": "string"
            },
            "url": "string"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In a diagram, this setup looks like this:

![With a confdb](docs/media/with-confdb.png)

The `net-ctrl` snap acts as the custodian of the confdb view. A custodian snap can validate the view data being written using [hooks](https://snapcraft.io/docs/supported-snap-hooks) such as `change-view-<plug>`.\
The other snaps are called "observers" or "readers" of the confdb view. They can use `observe-view-<plug>` hooks to watch changes to the view. This could be useful for the snaps to update their own confdb configuration and/or restart runnning services after configuration changes.\
A snap can be an observer and/or custodian of many different views.

The roles are defined as plugs in the respective snap's `snapcraft.yaml` like so:

**net-ctrl** (custodian)

```yaml
plugs:
  network-proxy-admin:
    interface: confdb
    account: <your-account-id>
    view: network/proxy-admin
    role: custodian

  network-proxy-state:
    interface: confdb
    account: <your-account-id>
    view: network/proxy-state
    role: custodian
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Here, `net-ctrl` is the custodian for both `network-proxy-admin` & `network-proxy-state`. This is because a view must have at least one custodian snap.

**browser** (observer/reader)

```yaml
plugs:
  network-proxy-state:
    interface: confdb
    account: <your-account-id>
    view: network/proxy-state
```

> [!NOTE]
> For observer/reader snaps, the role is implicit so you don't have to specify it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `account` field in each snap's `snapcraft.yaml` must match the `account-id` in your confdb-schema assertion. Update the `account` field in `net-ctrl/snap/snapcraft.yaml` and `browser/snap/snapcraft.yaml` to use your own Store account ID (found via `snapcraft whoami`).

### Create a `confdb-schema` Assertion

The confdb feature is currently behind an experimental flag. Enable it first:

```console
$ sudo snap set system experimental.confdb=true
```

> [!NOTE]
> Since confdb is an experimental feature, the implementation details may change as development progresses.

You can create a confdb-schema assertion with `snapcraft` which launches an editor to type the assertion in, then it signs the assertion & uploads it to the Store.

> [!TIP]
> Prefer to sign and acknowledge assertions locally without uploading to the Store? See [Creating a confdb-schema Assertion by Hand](#creating-a-confdb-schema-assertion-by-hand).

#### Prerequisites

If you do not have any snapcraft keys, create one and register it with the Store.

```console
$ snapcraft login   # if not already logged in
$ snapcraft whoami  # confirm
email: <email>
username: <username>
id: <your-account-id>
permissions: package_access, package_manage, package_metrics, package_push, package_register, package_release, package_update
channels: no restrictions
expires: 2025-10-25T08:38:11.000Z

$ snapcraft create-key <key-name>
$ snapcraft register-key <key-name>
```

### Create, Sign, & Upload to Store

Next, run `snapcraft edit-confdb-schema` which launches you into an editor where you can fill in the assertion's details.

```console
$ snapcraft edit-confdb-schema <your-account-id> network --key-name=<key-name>
Successfully created revision 1 for 'network'.

$ snapcraft confdb-schemas
Account ID                        Name      Revision  When
<your-account-id>                 network          1  2024-10-2
```

### Build & Install Snaps

Next, we'll build and install the `net-ctrl` and `browser` snaps in this repository.

#### net-ctrl snap

```console
$ cd net-ctrl
$ snapcraft pack
Packed net-ctrl_0.2_amd64.snap

$ sudo snap install net-ctrl_0.2_amd64.snap --dangerous
net-ctrl 0.2 installed
```

#### browser snap

```console
$ cd browser
$ snapcraft pack
Packed browser_0.2_amd64.snap

$ sudo snap install browser_0.2_amd64.snap --dangerous
browser 0.2 installed
```

### Interfaces

Next, we'll connect the [interfaces](https://snapcraft.io/docs/confdb-interface) for both snaps.

```console
$ sudo snap connect net-ctrl:network-proxy-admin
$ sudo snap connect net-ctrl:network-proxy-state
$ snap connections net-ctrl
Interface  Plug                          Slot     Notes
confdb     net-ctrl:network-proxy-admin  :confdb  manual
confdb     net-ctrl:network-proxy-state  :confdb  manual
home       net-ctrl:home                 :home    -

$ sudo snap connect browser:network-proxy-state
$ snap connections browser
Interface  Plug                         Slot      Notes
confdb     browser:network-proxy-state  :confdb   manual
network    browser:network              :network  -
```

> [!NOTE]
> For snaps installed from the Store, if the assertion's `account-id` is the same as the snap publisher, the interfaces should be connected automatically.

### Setting & Reading Configuration

#### With `snapctl`

Confdb views can only be set if there is at least one snap on the system with a "custodian" role plug for that view.

The commands take the form:
  - `snapctl set --view :<view-name> <dotted.path>=<value>`
  - `snapctl get --view :<view-name> [<dotted.path>] [-d]`

```console
$ sudo snap run --shell net-ctrl.sh
# snapctl set --view :network-proxy-admin https.url=https://proxy.example.com
# snapctl set --view :network-proxy-admin ftp.url=ftp://proxy.example.com
# exit

$ snap run --shell browser
# snapctl get --view :network-proxy-state
{
    "ftp": {
        "bypass": [
            "*://*.company.internal"
        ],
        "url": "ftp://proxy.example.com"
    },
    "https": {
        "bypass": [
            "*://*.company.internal"
        ],
        "url": "https://proxy.example.com"
    }
}

# snapctl get --view :network-proxy-state https
{
    "bypass": [
        "*://*.company.internal"
    ],
    "url": "https://proxy.example.com"
}
# exit
```

#### With `snap set`

The commands take the form:
  - `snap set <your-account-id>/<confdb-schema>/<view> <dotted.path>=<value>`
  - `snap get <your-account-id>/<confdb-schema>/<view> [<dotted.path>] [-d]`

```console
$ sudo snap set <your-account-id>/network/proxy-admin 'https.bypass=["https://127.0.0.1", "https://localhost"]'

$ sudo snap get <your-account-id>/network/proxy-state ftp
Key         Value
ftp.bypass  [*://*.company.internal]
ftp.url     ftp://proxy.example.com
$ sudo snap get <your-account-id>/network/proxy-state ftp -d
{
    "ftp": {
        "bypass": [
            "*://*.company.internal"
        ],
        "url": "ftp://proxy.example.com"
    }
}
$ sudo snap get <your-account-id>/network/proxy-admin ftp.url
ftp://proxy.example.com
```

#### With the snapd REST API

```console
$ sudo curl --unix-socket /run/snapd.socket \
  "http://localhost/v2/confdb/<your-account-id>/network/proxy-admin" \
  -X PUT -d '{"https.bypass": ["https://127.0.0.1", "https://localhost"]}' -s | jq

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The API documentation is available [here](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapd-api#heading--confdb).

## Hooks

A [hook](https://snapcraft.io/docs/supported-snap-hooks) is an executable file that runs within a snap's confined environment when a certain action occurs.\
Snaps can implement hooks to manage and observe confdb views. The hooks are `change-view-<plug>`, `save-view-<plug>`, `load-view-<plug>`, `query-view-<plug>`, & `observe-view-<plug>`. For this demo, we'll look at `change-view-<plug>` and `observe-view-<plug>`.

> [!TIP]
> When debugging failing hooks, run `snap changes` and then `snap tasks <N>` to get the error details.

### browser/observe-view-network-proxy-state (`observe-view-<plug>`)

This hook allows the browser snap to watch for changes to the proxy state view. [The hook](./browser/snap/hooks/observe-view-network-proxy-state) outputs the new configuration to `$SNAP_COMMON/new-config.json`.

```console
$ sudo net-ctrl.sh -c 'snapctl set --view :network-proxy-admin https.url="http://localhost:3199/"'
$ snap changes

        "bypass": [
            "*://*.company.internal"
        ],
        "url": "ftp://proxy.example.com"
    },
    "https": {
        "bypass": [
            "https://127.0.0.1",
            "https://localhost",
            "*://*.company.internal"
        ],
        "url": "http://localhost:3199/"
    }
}
```

### net-ctrl/change-view-network-proxy-admin (`change-view-<plug>`)

#### Example 1: Validation

You can use a `change-view-<plug>` hook to do data validation. For instance, [the hook](./net-ctrl/snap/hooks/change-view-network-proxy-admin) checks that `{protocol}.url` is a valid URL.

```console
$ sudo net-ctrl.sh -c 'snapctl set --view :network-proxy-admin https.url="not a url?"'
$ snap changes
ID    Status  Spawn                   Ready                   Summary

2025-03-25T11:21:21+03:00 ERROR run hook "change-view-network-proxy-admin": failed to validate url: not a url?
```

#### Example 2: Decoration

You can also use a `change-view-<plug>` hook to do data decoration. For instance, [the hook](./net-ctrl/snap/hooks/change-view-network-proxy-admin) ensures that internal company URLs are never proxied.

```console
$ sudo snap run --shell net-ctrl.sh
# snapctl set --view :network-proxy-admin 'https.bypass=["localhost"]'

# snapctl get --view :network-proxy-admin
{
    "ftp": {
        "bypass": [
            "*://*.company.internal"
        ],
        "url": "ftp://proxy.example.com"
    },
    "https": {
        "bypass": [
            "localhost",
            "*://*.company.internal"
        ],
        "url": "http://localhost:3199/"
    }
}
```

## What's Next?

🎉 **Congratulations!** You've successfully completed the demo!

What next? Learn how to integrate confdb with external configuration sources using **[ephemeral data](./docs/ephemeral-data.md)**. This advanced pattern shows how to automatically sync confdb views with external sources.

## Addendum

### Creating a confdb-schema Assertion by Hand

Writing assertion JSON by hand is painful because the `body` field requires escaped JSON. We recommend using YAML which supports comments and multi-line strings, then converting to JSON with `yq`.

An example YAML file is provided in this repository: [`network-confdb-schema.yaml`](./network-confdb-schema.yaml)

#### Prerequisites

Install `yq` ([installation options](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq?tab=readme-ov-file#install)):

```console
$ sudo snap install yq
```

If you do not have any snapcraft keys, create one and register it with the Store.

```console
$ snapcraft login   # if not already logged in
$ snapcraft whoami  # confirm
email: <email>
username: <username>
id: <your-account-id>
permissions: package_access, package_manage, package_metrics, package_push, package_register, package_release, package_update
channels: no restrictions
expires: 2025-10-25T08:38:11.000Z

$ snapcraft create-key <key-name>
$ snapcraft register-key <key-name>
```

#### Edit, Sign & Acknowledge

First, edit the YAML file to replace the placeholders with your actual values:
- `<your-account-id>`: your Store account ID
- `<timestamp>`: current UTC timestamp (run `date -Iseconds --utc`)

Then convert the YAML file to JSON:

```console
$ yq -o=json network-confdb-schema.yaml > network-confdb-schema.json
```

Next, sign the assertion and acknowledge it:

```console
$ snap sign -k <key-name> network-confdb-schema.json > network-confdb-schema.assert
$ sudo snap ack network-confdb-schema.assert
```

###### Errors You Might Encounter

**cannot resolve prerequisite assertion**

This error occurs when trying to acknowledge the assertion but some requisite assertions are not found locally. We'll need to fetch them from the Store.

To fetch and acknowledge your `account` assertion, run:

```console
$ snap known --remote account account-id=<your-account-id> > /tmp/account.assert
$ sudo snap ack /tmp/account.assert
```

To fetch and acknowledge the `account-key` assertion, run:

```console
$ snap known --remote account-key public-key-sha3-384=<key-sha-digest> > /tmp/account-key.assert
$ sudo snap ack /tmp/account-key.assert
```

> [!TIP]
> Make sure you have a key registered with the Store: `snapcraft register-key <key-name>`

> [!TIP]
> To get the `key-sha-digest`, run `snap keys` and pick it from the `SHA3-384` column.

Finally, `ack` the confdb-schema assertion itself.

### Checking if the `browser` snap works

Run the web proxy on a host (like `proxy.example.com`) or locally in a docker container:

```console
$ docker run -d --name squid-container -e TZ=UTC -p 3128:3128 ubuntu/squid:5.2-22.04_beta
```

Point the `http/https` proxy configuration to the web proxy and then call `browser` with a proxied URL:

```console
$ sudo net-ctrl.sh -c 'snapctl set --view :network-proxy-admin https.url="http://localhost:3128/"'
$ browser "https://example.com"
